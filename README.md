# Welcome to the Vision AI Taskphase!

This is the main repository in which you'll have to commit the code you write through PRs

## ML Exercises

```
* Do a git pull into the cloned directory you've been working with
* There are 2 notebooks in each section
* Go through the walkthrough notebook first to get familiar with ML using python
* Solve the exercises and then commit the code
* Push the code into your forked repo and then make a PR to the branch with your name
* You can send the PR to the master branch as well
* For that copy the exercise notebook with your name
```
